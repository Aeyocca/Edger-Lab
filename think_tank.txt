Comprehensive exam -- aim for Start of 5 semester (after the second year). Fall 2019


Background/Core Aims: Based on recent analysis of pangenomes, a large portion of the genome exhibits copy number and presence/absence variation consisting of genes that are highly enriched with encoding adaptive traits (e.g. stress response, disease resistance, flowering time, etc). Furthermore, recent efforts have identified tens of thousands of conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) in the genome with putative functions involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes. Exact functions for specific CNSs remain either completely unknown or poorly understood. 

Here are a few key questions that emerge; 
A. Does CNS structure differ between tandemly duplicated genes (CNV/PAV subset of the genome) and dosage sensitive genes (core genome)? - Alan 

	I. Pan-Brassicaceae (family level) ** 1-2 days
	II. Pan-Brassica (species/genus level) ** Done

^ CNS have already been identified for Brassicaceae

	III. Pan-Fragaria vesca (species level) - To do
	IV. Pan-Rosaceae (family level) ** 1-2 days

^^ No CNS have been identified
Look across A. thaliana for CNS differences / hopefully functional enrichment for stress responsive genes
Start with 18 accessions, MCScanX call orthologs, look upstream
CoGe / progressiveCactus
Pull coordinates out / take from GFF file, pull sequences upstream, blast search above a certain bit score
Make CNS GFF file, treat like exon, search for synteny
Presence / absence or SNPs

A2. Are there CNS abundance differences among different gene age groups? Gene families? 
“Variable/Expendable” vs “Core” Genome - Alan

Expectation: CNS conservation is higher within Core genome. Core genome is more highly connected (more edges) compared to dispensable genome. 

B. Does CNS fractionation/diversification lead to functional divergence and network evolution (i.e. rewiring) following gene and genome duplications? - Alan
Test - ‘Escape from Adaptive Conflict’
https://www.nature.com/articles/nature07092

Alan - Wants to layer on methylation data, ATAC-seq, etc to analyze CNSs.

C. Which CNS are associated with regulating the expression of (a)biotic stress resistance genes? Putative TF binding sites?

Need to validate with functional data. 
Table for the moment -- Think about what datasets need to be generated or obtained from collaborators.
Pat - Contact Klaas ASAP.
