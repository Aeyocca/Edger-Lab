Overview:
- took 1001 data, looked for loss of function alleles, used satellite data on seasonal drought conditions, found association between flowering time and drought timing / frequency. 
- Early drought, late flower
- late drought, early flower
- found loss of function alleles associated with these phenotypes with some functional knockouts too that affect FT.
- many more early flowering gene associations than late flowering (likely because Col-0 is early flowering)
- Found genes associated with drought timing and or flowering time
  - found 247 in this category out of 2088 tested genes with LoFunction allele in at least 5% of ecotypes tested
- seemingly generated gene models based on SNP data for ecotype alleles and used that for ka/ks calculation?
  - not sure, ka/ks a little vague whether they just tested candidate genes in Col-0 or across ecotypes
- permutation tests were a single permutation, but outcome was severly far from data I think it is fine
