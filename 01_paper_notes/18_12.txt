Overview:
- took 1001 data, looked for loss of function alleles, used satellite data on seasonal drought conditions, found association between flowering time and drought timing / frequency. 
- Early drought, late flower
- late drought, early flower
- found loss of function alleles associated with these phenotypes with some functional knockouts too that affect FT.
- many more early flowering gene associations than late flowering (likely because Col-0 is early flowering)
- Found genes associated with drought timing and or flowering time
  - found 247 in this category out of 2088 tested genes with LoFunction allele in at least 5% of ecotypes tested
- seemingly generated gene models based on SNP data for ecotype alleles and used that for ka/ks calculation?
  - not sure, ka/ks a little vague whether they just tested candidate genes in Col-0 or across ecotypes
- permutation tests were a single permutation, but outcome was severly far from data I think it is fine

Title: Species-Specific Changes in a Primate Transcription Factor Network Provide Insights into the Molecular Evolution of the Primate Prefrontal Cortex
Authors: Stefano Berto and Katja Nowick

- Network differences between Primate and Human using Rhesus as outgroup
- used wTO instead of WGCNA, this allows differences in edges to be found, not just nodes
- interesting, number of species specific expression patterns even when normalized for evo distance from MRCA of the three
- Manually curated list of "Brain-TFs", brain specific expression overrep in human specific TF expression patters but not the other two species
  - but... that list was made by looking at humans, so the list of Brain-TFs might be overrep with lineage specific genes for Human
  - Counteracting this a little, did not find increases in connectivity in tissues OTHER than brain
- "but wTO values correlate between the net- works (Pearson correlation, r^2 = 0.13, P < 2.2 􏰅 10􏰂16)."
  - I guess r-squared of 0.13 is good for network value correlation
  - hmm not sure what this value measures, I guess network similarity? Well its closer than expected by chance
  - this comparison not even super important: its all TF net vs lineage specific net
- What is biological significance of higher connectivity in network? what does this mean?
  - I think it means we just found way more genes like this in humans
  - and in human lineage, greater pleiotropy
  - the power would be which of these interactions responsible for human specific traits?
- Changes in genes these networks regulate changes less, it seems, following hypothesis that network changes can be non adaptive and change without changing functions

check out this guy for insight on hypothesis: "Our finding agrees with the hypothesis that many new network links can arise non-adaptively and can be added to or deleted from the network without changing its function"
