Conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) in higher plants
Michael Freeling and Shabarinath Subramaniam

  - Maybe CNS are consequence of selection on genes. Maybe thats why they cluster around genes, I mean they totally are conserved for regulatory purposes, but there could be some that are around simply by LD, To get evidence of this, could look for signs of strong selection in nearby genes, higher selection genes will have probably more CNSs as there will be less recomb. Perhaps older genes will have closer CNS, and new strong selected genes will have CNS further away
  - Concept of useful divergence: not too close but not too far. Too close would produce carryover from ancestor kind of like I stated above. Too far and binding sites will be difficult to pick out from sequence alone. How often do binding motifs change? How conserved are TF binding motifs? across all plants? what are the proportions in each class (conserved, semi-conserved, highly variable)?
  - I don't but the argument on useful divergence. I think it just makes things harder outside of this window. Probably not impossible. Will most certainly get less information outside of this window. Is that just misguided? Brassicaceae seems to be within this window. 
  - Spacing of CNSs can vary greatly between species
  - it says binding sites degrade relatively quickly on an evolutionary time scale, but function seems to remain the same. Well binding sites are out of protein coding regions so more likely to mutate, but what recognizes them is a protein in most cases which needs very specific properties to recognize these sites, so shouldn't changes in binding sites require changes in protein structure???? Aside from direct binding there could be like enhancer and stabilization roles for these CNSs. I guess it doesn't make sense to me why or how these binding sites turn over yet retain the same function.
  - CNS are 5' skewed in Arabidopsis
  - A little confused, it seems CNSs are enriched in regulatory genes, but shouldn't we expect them the be enriched in regulatory gene TARGETS? I mean, chicken and egg situation right? not really, signal comes in, binds to existing protein which switches on / off TFs / genes, why have the TFs then? I guess can respond differently in different cells thats where methylation makes sense
    - To address this, the corporation metaphor, this thing must be one big system to respond to stress, no straight line path for it. "The master regulators must themselves be highly regulated"
    
    
    
    
The Most Deeply Conserved Noncoding Sequences in Plants Serve Similar Functions to Those in Vertebrates Despite Large Differences in Evolutionary Rates
Diane Burgess and Michael Freeling

  - Something must be evolutionarily different between plants and animals since verts have many CNEs and plants really don't have any
  - Deeply conserved CNS <11kb away from genes compared to megabases in vertebrates
  - ~70% of deep CNSs are intergenic, mostly 5' but some 3'
  - eudicot CNS enriched for TF activity
  - Published function of mono-eud CNS: THIC, micro-RNA, SHY/STI TFs and some MADS-BOX TF, CArG3
  - super deep CNSs associated with RNA / alternative splicing is usually intragenic
  - Synergistic binding on overlapping opposite strands / grooves Guturu et al 2013
  - ********say some animal CNE differences bc of WGD, evidence WGD responsible for reduction of CNE so might expect same to be true in plant lineages, addition to looking at evo distance, check out WGD events as polyploidy leads to a lax selection of CNSs, but is it really as dramatic as the numbers say it is?
  - No reason to despair, can still study this process of how CNSs change / what their dynamics are
  
  Fractionation mutagenesis and similar consequences of mechanisms removing dispensable or less-expressed DNA in plants
Michael Freeling, Margaret R Woodhouse, Shabarinath Subramaniam, Gina Turco, Damon Lisch, James C Schnable
  - Repeats flank regions of deletion of duplicated genes, evidence of intrachromosomal recombination. Same mechanism that removes TEs.
  - subgenome dominance allows stoichiometry to be maintained while other copies mutate
  - polyploidy has to have an immediate fitness effect right? are all polyploid events single organism? why are they swept through the population if they are just going to psuedogenize?
  
  
Evolution of Stress-Regulated Gene Expression in Duplicate Genes of Arabidopsis thaliana
Cheng Zou, Melissa D. Lehti-Shiu, Michael Thomashow, Shin-Han Shiu

  - Use gene family information to infer ancestral state, probably not the most accurate but the best they had to go off of here
  - 16 different stresses in AtExpGeneAtlas or something like that, I think its microarray data, yea this was published in 2009
  - Partitioning is the most likely result, could be due to biased retention of subfunc genes, would also respect retention to be over rep bc of dosage balance. While sig lower compared to random background, was still >> loss (in both copies)
  
  TF2Network: predicting transcription factor regulators and gene regulatory networks in Arabidopsis using publicly available binding site information
Shubhada R. Kulkarni, Dries Vaneechoutte, Jan Van de Velde, Klaas Vandepoele

  - Look 5kb upstream, mask exons, look 1 kb downstream. Accuracy in recovering known TFBS from ChIP and DH exps was greatest using 5kb upstream so they leave that as the default. Whats out distribution of CNSs? Seems like many more deep CNSs are <11kb away as stated in one of the papers above, so seems
  - How relatable is this to organisms outside of Arabidopsis?? What evo distance before BSs are no longer very conserved / meaningful
  - built GRNs, overlay known GO annotations, do guilt by association. Able to do guilt by association for >6k/~11k genes with unknown function. Looked at RNA-seq data sets, DE agreed with guilt by association assignment in most cases. For example, GRN regulon with known salt responsive element, unkown gene also DE in salt stress.
  - not super high recovery rate for circadian rhythm GO annotation, but still found some new ones which is cool

A Collection of Conserved Noncoding Sequences to Study Gene Regulation in Flowering Plants1[OPEN]
Jan Van de Velde, Michiel Van Bel, Dries Vaneechoutte, and Klaas Vandepoele

  - Large number of non-function TFBS
  - Assign TFBS function by functional enrichment of target genes
  - To make sure CNS were not previously unannotated proteins, BLASTX to all known plant proteins
  - Strong negative correlation between genome size and % CNS found in first 500bp upstream. Seems like 501-2000 is a subtle difference so I am a little surprised by that
  - Got strong validation of their predicted TF functions from target GO enrichment
  
  
 Some word vomit on what to discuss tomorrow:
  - Want to identify some new TFBS invovled in stress
  - Want to track evolutionary changes of TFBSs
  - Want to analyze network rewiring in some places
  - Genome / transcriptome assembly
  - CNS pipeline
  - Stress / stage specific expression in Rosaceae
  - I mean really all I am doing is clever comparisons right? So what are the most clever comparisons? What questions do I want to answer? Do I want to model the process of TFBS evolution? Model Network change? Track changes in potentially agronomic important network?
  - As far as experiments, I should mine existing resources, how to make a decision on which resources to generate? What would be worth the time? 
  - Lets get specific:
    - Identify putative TFBSs, best ways:
      - ChIP seq / DHS support
      - Could do stress responsive ones using the differential stress data
      - For the TFBS functional enrichment, there was strong support for accuracy when simply GO enrichment on targets, but that might have some ascertainment bias associated with it
      - What could you do that is new to find TFBS? I think the kmer enrichment is pretty slick. check for signs of selection in regions upstream / downstream of genes
      - Is is possible to gain more support for long range TFBS interactions using Hi-C / some sort of Chromatin hybridization technique
      - Although really whats the prevalence of these interactions / what would I gain? Seems to me based on readings that just throwing out there ~90% are within 5kbp right?
      - Ideally what do I want to say about TFBS evolution? What is my hypothesis? Hypothesize they will be recovered in CNS regions, they will be to a certain extent variable between clades, they will show signs of selection, Many are unknown currently, many could have multiple binding sites associated with it. The distance to target gene is expected to be proximal. Their presence will be some of the first step in subfunctionalization / maybe psuedogenization (but nonsense subs should come first right? Well maybe those will only come once no longer expressed) Seems like a lot of this hinges on TFBS being the main driver behind expression right? Well many would argue chromatin organization is more important right? Should layer that on next really in these comparisons, I think there is some good information to be had there

  - What about my really out there ideas?
    - Something about crop improvement
    - develop method to identify CNS / regulons
    - Model plant regulatory evolution
    - predict what genes are about to subfunctionalize
    - drive the subfunctionalization / neofunctionalization by some sort of knockout / directed artificial selection
    - Diversity panels / RIL population would be really handy for some regulatory element comparisons, right?
    - Whats the mechanism of going from silenced to unsilenced, like how important is the chromatin modification???
    - Should I do whole genome alignment stuff or do some phylo footprint where just looking proximal to orthologs? 
    - I think there is some way to work with the meme format, I think its called a position weight matrix?
