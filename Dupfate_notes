#Duplication fate project, looking at expression patterns in duplicated genes with cleome as outgroup expression value, well looking at up / downregulation under stresses (determined by edgeR) as character states to reconstruct ancestral up/downregulation state to look for evidence of subfunctionalization. After the genes with differential response to stress have been identified, their conserved non-coding sequences (CNSs) will be examined, hopefully will be able to find enriched kmer which corresponds to stress responsive element to which TFs bind

12-28-17
Just got back from break, before break / during wrote script (sub_filter.pl) to parse a few files. Had already determined whether certain genes were up / downregulated in response to different stresses. Examined that set of files to create a file where each line lists a single cleome gene name that shows an informative expression change between cleome and two duplicated a. thaliana copies of a gene. Will use this file to extract CNSs for these genes and perform kmer enrichment.

I have comp_cold.txt created output from sub_filter.pl which has tab separated [at edgeR number] [at subgenome copy 1 exp diff value] [at subgenome copy 2 exp diff value] [cleome exp diff value]

I wrote summary_stats.pl to output the informative genes and also print to command line how many were printed, I guess I could combine this with the other script, but they are already separate, and this way incase we want to examine genes without the pattern we were looking for (ONLY 1 at copy sharing state with CV) we got the full list.

Lets fix sub_filter.pl to include a fifth and sixth column with the TAIR10 gene name and cleome ortholog gene name respectively.


$ ./sub_filter.pl -p temp.txt -i At-Index.txt -a AtAlpha_Cv_4KT.txt -t edgeR_Arabidopsis_ColdALL_05_OUT_DEG.csv -c edgeR_Cv_ColdALL_05_OUT_DEG.txt -e Cv_Control1-6_GeneID.csv -o comp_cold.txt
1400 lines were written to comp_cold.txt

33602 lines were read in the at exp file

$ ./summary_stats.pl -i comp_cold.txt -o inf_cold.txt
1400 genes were analyzed
361 genes were informative and written to inf_cold.txt

Make files for other treatments:

oopsy, got some problems
I remember now,
************************IMPORTANT********************************
The files sent to me were written on pc, so they have DOS carriage returns. Only way I know to fix is to upload file to hpcc, because my terminal doesn't have the dos2unix command. Need to log onto dev node also,

$ ./sub_filter.pl -p temp.txt -i At-Index.txt -a AtAlpha_Cv_4KT.txt -t edgeR_Arabidopsis_SaltALL_05_OUT_DEG.csv -c edgeR_Cv_SaltALL_05_OUT_DEG.txt -e Cv_Control1-6_GeneID.csv -o comp_salt.txt
0 lines were written to comp_salt.txt

0 lines were read in the at exp file

I think there is some flag I need but I can't remember what it was, use vi instead:
:1,$s/^M/\r/g
(enter ^M by pressing ctl+v then enter)

there we go, that did it, only needed to edit the arabidopsis ones, I think the dos2unix without any flags worked on the cv ones

Whats the degree of overlap between these gene sets?

Next I want to look for enriched kmers in CNSs of stress responsive (both up and down reg) genes.
To do this, I need two bins for kmer enrichment: background bin with non-repsonsive gene CNSs and treatment bin with responsive CNSs.
Need: script that will look through a set of genes with exp response direction (comp_[stress].txt or inf_[stress].txt files) and output just a list of at geneIDs with 4 different files: 2 non responsive genes one paired with up / down reg. and 2 responsive genes, one up one down. Look at the conditionals in the script, will explain much better than I can with words. 
Run this script through the 3 stresses, and through both comp / inf files. should end up with 24 files (create separate directory for them)

*********NONUPs are genes with NO CHANGE in treatment, whose PARALOG is UP regulated in the treatment*************************


Then the hard part will be extracting CNSs but we can think about those later.

Alriighty, lets hope jellyfish will read these correctly, looks like it does, write different scripts for 5,6,7mer to iterate through all files:

make a script to make scatterplot dataframes comparing the percentage frequency of kmer in stress vs. overall kmer frequency. So need to run jellyfish on base cns file

since query is so short (5 nt since doing 5mers at the moment), need to add -W flag which sets word length. not entirely sure what that means but the default is 11 and since our query is 5, its finding zero hits, found some post recommending setting this to half the query length, but the minimum is 4, so we are sticking with that

lowest E value obtained seems to be 5.1, probably lowest posible with 5 nt query. Lets start creating the 7mer permutation files then while trying to parse through this blast output

make histogram of significance values. whats best way to remove NAs? grep not matching, yea

- make sub genome exp into table
- Think about tracking CNS changes, whats informative?
- What does this putative function list tell me?
	- What sort of comparisons should I be making across all 8 files within stress / over/underrepresentation. 
	-What are the expected functions of kmers overrep in non-responsive genes (since there are so few compared to the changed exp ones **********MAKE A TABLE********* perhaps they are just showing up there because they do show a change, but edgeR filters are too stringent, interesting to directly compare FPKM of genes in that category, might be too cyclical as far as tracking those genes down, might just be easier to lower constraints and rerun edgeR, that would be good because I would learn how to use it too, look that up later

PUTATIVE FUNCTION, COULD B DIFF FUNCS SHARE 7 BP CONSENSUS BC GOOD FOR TF BINDING


reading the Shui paper again, Those that don't respond anymore have lost the cis elements, genes that lost response to one stress, gained response to another. Rates of expression response changes decrease over evolutionary time. The proportion of nonfunctionalization of copies increases over evolutionary time. 

- Larger effective population size may result in greater duplicate exp divergence

- presence of broad spectrum cis elements over rep in pairs showing Asy=1 (one ancestral, other loss) compared to pairs showing symmetric response, thats interesting, you would think the broad responsive elements would maintain symmetry, they argue the differential loss of these broad responsive elements may be responsible for asymmetric response
- sub-neofunctionalization, neofunct usually occurs on duplicate that did not inherit the ancestral response, but duh kind of right? has to lose original function most likely first, if accumulating mutations randomly, going to do bad before you do good? IT CANT BE A RANDOM PROCESS, I ALMOST REFUSE TO BELIEVE IT, MAYBE I NEED TO RETHINK THE NUMBERS BUT NO WAY RANDOM MUTATIONS RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING WE SEE TODAY, MAYBE THE NUMBERS ARE SMALLER THAN I THINK BUT DAMN, CANT BE COMPLETELY RANDOM. Big innovations have to be non-random, right?
