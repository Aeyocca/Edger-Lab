#Duplication fate project, looking at expression patterns in duplicated genes with cleome as outgroup expression value, well looking at up / downregulation under stresses (determined by edgeR) as character states to reconstruct ancestral up/downregulation state to look for evidence of subfunctionalization. After the genes with differential response to stress have been identified, their conserved non-coding sequences (CNSs) will be examined, hopefully will be able to find enriched kmer which corresponds to stress responsive element to which TFs bind

Just got back from break, before break / during wrote script (sub_filter.pl) to parse a few files. Had already determined whether certain genes were up / downregulated in response to different stresses. Examined that set of files to create a file where each line lists a single cleome gene name that shows an informative expression change between cleome and two duplicated a. thaliana copies of a gene. Will use this file to extract CNSs for these genes and perform kmer enrichment.

I have comp_cold.txt created output from sub_filter.pl which has tab separated [at edgeR number] [at subgenome copy 1 exp diff value] [at subgenome copy 2 exp diff value] [cleome exp diff value]

I wrote summary_stats.pl to output the informative genes and also print to command line how many were printed, I guess I could combine this with the other script, but they are already separate, and this way incase we want to examine genes without the pattern we were looking for (ONLY 1 at copy sharing state with CV) we got the full list.

Lets fix sub_filter.pl to include a fifth and sixth column with the TAIR10 gene name and cleome ortholog gene name respectively.


$ ./sub_filter.pl -p temp.txt -i At-Index.txt -a AtAlpha_Cv_4KT.txt -t edgeR_Arabidopsis_ColdALL_05_OUT_DEG.csv -c edgeR_Cv_ColdALL_05_OUT_DEG.txt -e Cv_Control1-6_GeneID.csv -o comp_cold.txt
1400 lines were written to comp_cold.txt

33602 lines were read in the at exp file

$ ./summary_stats.pl -i comp_cold.txt -o inf_cold.txt
1400 genes were analyzed
361 genes were informative and written to inf_cold.txt

Make files for other treatments:

oopsy, got some problems
I remember now,
************************IMPORTANT********************************
The files sent to me were written on pc, so they have DOS carriage returns. Only way I know to fix is to upload file to hpcc, because my terminal doesn't have the dos2unix command. Need to log onto dev node also,

$ ./sub_filter.pl -p temp.txt -i At-Index.txt -a AtAlpha_Cv_4KT.txt -t edgeR_Arabidopsis_SaltALL_05_OUT_DEG.csv -c edgeR_Cv_SaltALL_05_OUT_DEG.txt -e Cv_Control1-6_GeneID.csv -o comp_salt.txt
0 lines were written to comp_salt.txt

0 lines were read in the at exp file

I think there is some flag I need but I can't remember what it was, use vi instead:
:1,$s/^M/\r/g
(enter ^M by pressing ctl+v then enter)

there we go, that did it, only needed to edit the arabidopsis ones, I think the dos2unix without any flags worked on the cv ones

Whats the degree of overlap between these gene sets?

Next I want to look for enriched kmers in CNSs of stress responsive (both up and down reg) genes.
To do this, I need two bins for kmer enrichment: background bin with non-repsonsive gene CNSs and treatment bin with responsive CNSs.
Need: script that will look through a set of genes with exp response direction (comp_[stress].txt or inf_[stress].txt files) and output just a list of at geneIDs with 4 different files: 2 non responsive genes one paired with up / down reg. and 2 responsive genes, one up one down. Look at the conditionals in the script, will explain much better than I can with words. 
Run this script through the 3 stresses, and through both comp / inf files. should end up with 24 files (create separate directory for them)

Then the hard part will be extracting CNSs but we can think about those later.

Thats pretty interesting, only 2 occurrences of at1/2 one zero, and cv opposite of non-zero value (if that makes sense: only 2 occurrences of 1 0 -1, 0 1 -1, -1 0 1, 0 -1 1) those 4 different possibilities, at random should occur 1400*(4/(3^3)) =~ 207 times

Now we need to go from list of gene IDs to one file with just a string of CNSs
